# Coding Challenge Solutions

## Introduction
This repository contains Python scripts developed to solve coding challenges proposed by Target Sistemas. Each file addresses a specific task and provides a solution using Python programming.

## Projects
- `1-fibonacci.py` : A script that checks if a given number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence.
- `2-check-letter-a.py` : A script that counts how many times the letter 'a' (case-insensitive) appears in a given string.
- `3-SOMA-check.py` : A script that calculates the value of a sum based on a specific algorithm.

## Installation
To run these scripts on your local machine, you'll need to have Python installed. 
- Download Python - [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
  
## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script you want to run is located.
3. Execute the script using Python.
